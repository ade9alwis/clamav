This is not a virus scanning software, but you can use this script for scanning viruses with  ClamAV. ClamAV is an open-source antivirus software run on multi-platform. After defining the path variable, the script automatically generates the report according to your destination path. Not only that, but it can also use as a cron job for scanning the system routinely against viruses. There is no background processes are running with this script for updating the virus signatures, so it does not consume resources unnecessarily. However, it updates the virus signatures with ClamAV before the beginning of the scanning process.
